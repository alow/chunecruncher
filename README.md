ChuneCruncher
=============

First scripts I wrote in ruby ages ago to help me with some file cleanup.

## chune-parser
Uses MusicBrainz and Last.fm to identify MP3s and set their IDv3 tags.
It also gets some meta information as to the number of plays for the tracks and
album

## chune-sort
Uses the meta information found from parsing to normalize the number of times a
song has been played and then rate the tracks from 1 to 5, and move the files
into the appropriate location
